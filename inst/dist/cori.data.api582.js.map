In particular, it is *not* possible to interpret an unset\n * or empty timezone as the same as \"UTC\".\n *\n * Conversion between timezones\n * ----------------------------\n *\n * If a Timestamp column has a non-empty timezone, changing the timezone\n * to a different non-empty value is a metadata-only operation:\n * the timestamp values need not change as their point of reference remains\n * the same (the Unix epoch).\n *\n * However, if a Timestamp column has no timezone value, changing it to a\n * non-empty value requires to think about the desired semantics.\n * One possibility is to assume that the original timestamp values are\n * relative to the epoch of the timezone being set; timestamp values should\n * then adjusted to the Unix epoch (for example, changing the timezone from\n * empty to \"Europe/Paris\" would require converting the timestamp values\n * from \"Europe/Paris\" to \"UTC\", which seems counter-intuitive but is\n * nevertheless correct).\n *\n * Guidelines for encoding data from external libraries\n * ----------------------------------------------------\n *\n * Date & time libraries often have multiple different data types for temporal\n * data. In order to ease interoperability between different implementations the\n * Arrow project has some recommendations for encoding these types into a Timestamp\n * column.\n *\n * An \"instant\" represents a physical point in time that has no relevant timezone\n * (for example, astronomical data). To encode an instant, use a Timestamp with\n * the timezone string set to \"UTC\", and make sure the Timestamp values\n * are relative to the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).\n *\n * A \"zoned date-time\" represents a physical point in time annotated with an\n * informative timezone (for example, the timezone in which the data was\n * recorded).  To encode a zoned date-time, use a Timestamp with the timezone\n * string set to the name of the timezone, and make sure the Timestamp values\n * are relative to the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).\n *\n *  (There is some ambiguity between an instant and a zoned date-time with the\n *   UTC timezone.  Both of these are stored the same in Arrow.  Typically,\n *   this distinction does not matter.  If it does, then an application should\n *   use custom metadata or an extension type to distinguish between the two cases.)\n *\n * An \"offset date-time\" represents a physical point in time combined with an\n * explicit offset from UTC.  To encode an offset date-time, use a Timestamp\n * with the timezone string set to the numeric timezone offset string\n * (e.g. \"+03:00\"), and make sure the Timestamp values are relative to\n * the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).\n *\n * A \"naive date-time\" (also called \"local date-time\" in some libraries)\n * represents a wall clock time combined with a calendar date, but with\n * no indication of how to map this information to a physical point in time.\n * Naive date-times must be handled with care because of this missing\n * information, and also because daylight saving time (DST) may make\n * some values ambiguous or nonexistent. A naive date-time may be\n * stored as a struct with Date and Time fields. However, it may also be\n * encoded into a Timestamp column with an empty timezone. The timestamp\n * values should be computed \"as if\" the timezone of the date-time values\n * was UTC; for example, the naive date-time \"January 1st 1970, 00h00\" would\n * be encoded as timestamp value 0.\n */\nexport class Timestamp {\n    constructor() {\n        this.bb = null;\n        this.bb_pos = 0;\n    }\n    __init(i, bb) {\n        this.bb_pos = i;\n        this.bb = bb;\n        return this;\n    }\n    static getRootAsTimestamp(bb, obj) {\n        return (obj || new Timestamp()).__init(bb.readInt32(bb.position()) + bb.position(), bb);\n    }\n    static getSizePrefixedRootAsTimestamp(bb, obj) {\n        bb.setPosition(bb.position() + flatbuffers.SIZE_PREFIX_LENGTH);\n        return (obj || new Timestamp()).__init(bb.readInt32(bb.position()) + bb.position(), bb);\n    }\n    unit() {\n        const offset = this.bb.__offset(this.bb_pos, 4);\n        return offset ? this.bb.readInt16(this.bb_pos + offset) : TimeUnit.SECOND;\n    }\n    timezone(optionalEncoding) {\n        const offset = this.bb.__offset(this.bb_pos, 6);\n        return offset ? this.bb.__string(this.bb_pos + offset, optionalEncoding) : null;\n    }\n    static startTimestamp(builder) {\n        builder.startObject(2);\n    }\n    static addUnit(builder, unit) {\n        builder.addFieldInt16(0, unit, TimeUnit.SECOND);\n    }\n    static addTimezone(builder, timezoneOffset) {\n        builder.addFieldOffset(1, timezoneOffset, 0);\n    }\n    static endTimestamp(builder) {\n        const offset = builder.endObject();\n        return offset;\n    }\n    static createTimestamp(builder, unit, timezoneOffset) {\n        Timestamp.startTimestamp(builder);\n        Timestamp.addUnit(builder, unit);\n        Timestamp.addTimezone(builder, timezoneOffset);\n        return Timestamp.endTimestamp(builder);\n    }\n}\n\n//# sourceMappingURL=timestamp.mjs.map\n"],"names":["Timestamp","i","bb","obj","flatbuffers.SIZE_PREFIX_LENGTH","offset","TimeUnit","optionalEncoding","builder","unit","timezoneOffset"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AA8GO,MAAMA,EAAU;AAAA,EACnB,cAAc;AACV,SAAK,KAAK,MACV,KAAK,SAAS;AAAA,EACjB;AAAA,EACD,OAAOC,GAAGC,GAAI;AACV,gBAAK,SAASD,GACd,KAAK,KAAKC,GACH;AAAA,EACV;AAAA,EACD,OAAO,mBAAmBA,GAAIC,GAAK;AAC/B,YAAQA,KAAO,IAAIH,EAAS,GAAI,OAAOE,EAAG,UAAUA,EAAG,SAAU,CAAA,IAAIA,EAAG,SAAU,GAAEA,CAAE;AAAA,EACzF;AAAA,EACD,OAAO,+BAA+BA,GAAIC,GAAK;AAC3C,WAAAD,EAAG,YAAYA,EAAG,SAAU,IAAGE,CAA8B,IACrDD,KAAO,IAAIH,EAAS,GAAI,OAAOE,EAAG,UAAUA,EAAG,SAAU,CAAA,IAAIA,EAAG,SAAU,GAAEA,CAAE;AAAA,EACzF;AAAA,EACD,OAAO;AACH,UAAMG,IAAS,KAAK,GAAG,SAAS,KAAK,QAAQ,CAAC;AAC9C,WAAOA,IAAS,KAAK,GAAG,UAAU,KAAK,SAASA,CAAM,IAAIC,EAAS;AAAA,EACtE;AAAA,EACD,SAASC,GAAkB;AACvB,UAAMF,IAAS,KAAK,GAAG,SAAS,KAAK,QAAQ,CAAC;AAC9C,WAAOA,IAAS,KAAK,GAAG,SAAS,KAAK,SAASA,GAAQE,CAAgB,IAAI;AAAA,EAC9E;AAAA,EACD,OAAO,eAAeC,GAAS;AAC3B,IAAAA,EAAQ,YAAY,CAAC;AAAA,EACxB;AAAA,EACD,OAAO,QAAQA,GAASC,GAAM;AAC1B,IAAAD,EAAQ,cAAc,GAAGC,GAAMH,EAAS,MAAM;AAAA,EACjD;AAAA,EACD,OAAO,YAAYE,GAASE,GAAgB;AACxC,IAAAF,EAAQ,eAAe,GAAGE,GAAgB,CAAC;AAAA,EAC9C;AAAA,EACD,OAAO,aAAaF,GAAS;AAEzB,WADeA,EAAQ;EAE1B;AAAA,EACD,OAAO,gBAAgBA,GAASC,GAAMC,GAAgB;AAClD,WAAAV,EAAU,eAAeQ,CAAO,GAChCR,EAAU,QAAQQ,GAASC,CAAI,GAC/BT,EAAU,YAAYQ,GAASE,CAAc,GACtCV,EAAU,aAAaQ,CAAO;AAAA,EACxC;AACL;","x_google_ignoreList":[0]}
